As we know, the campus network of Sun Yat-san University is fully available of IPv6 access, which allowing us to visit many IPv6 websites and improving our network speed.

## Problem
However, we can not instantly acquire our IPv6 address as soon as we connect to campus network(by logging in via iNode). We have to be waiting passively for the address.
